      <p>
        Students who have questions during class sessions can post them on the site. The instructor responds. If the
        question wasn't asked earlier, the next group of students must ensure that it was, then ask it so the teacher
        can respond.

        The instructor might also use this platform to simplify any difficult passages on the slides, improve the
        presentation's materials, and address any potential student questions in advance. This will give the teacher a
        fantastic opportunity to make the most of the available time.
